*Dynamic X-O Game

Welcome to the Dynamic X-O Game! This innovative twist on the classic tic-tac-toe game keeps the excitement alive by ensuring that the board never holds more than three 'X's and three 'O's at any given time.

Features
Dynamic Gameplay: Each turn, the oldest move is removed, allowing for a constantly evolving game state.
Simple Interface: Easy-to-use interface for quick and enjoyable gameplay.
Strategic Depth: Players must think ahead, balancing offense and defense with a limited number of positions.
How to Play
Players take turns placing their 'X' or 'O' on the board.
After each move, the oldest position on the board is deleted, maintaining a total of three 'X's and three 'O's.
The first player to align three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!
